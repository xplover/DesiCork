        <h1>Important Documents and IDs</h1>
        <p>
            In this section, we will talk about the documents and IDs you must have in Ireland. We will talk about
            things in the sequence.
        </p>
        <section id="irp">
            <h2>Irish resident permit or IRP card</h2>
            <img src="irp.png" alt="irp card">
            <p>
                At the moment, you will go through the immigration at Cork
                Airport,
                the immigration officer will tell you to get an appointment for an IRP card. It is an official document
                that mentions your residency status and will help you re-enter Ireland when you travel abroad.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="sim">
            <h2>An Irish Sim card</h2>
            <img src="sim.jpg" alt="sim card">
            <p>
                You can buy an Irish sim card in any general store. The best option for tight budget
                students is GoMo and 48.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="bank">
            <h2>Student Bank Account</h2>
            <img src="bank.jpg" alt="bank">
            <p>
                We do not need to explain this. Ireland has many banks, but most students usually
                go for Allied Irish Bank(AIB).
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="leap">
            <h2>Student Leap card</h2>
            <img src="leap.png" alt="student leap card">
            <p>
                It is a travel that will help you to use the Cork bus service at discounted rates.
                You have to top-up the card to do that.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="stiud">
            <h2>Student ID card</h2>
            <img src="stuid.jpg" alt="student id">
            <p>
                You also should get an appointment for a Student ID card, as it will help you use the
                library, get print at a cheap rate(you need to add money to your ID card to do that), and you can also
                get some discount in the market.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="ppsn">
            <h2>PPSN or Personal Public service Number</h2>
            <img src="ppsn.webp" alt="ppsn card">
            <p>
                This is one of the <b>most important</b> and also the trickiest one.
                You must have this number if you want to work anywhere, including part-time and full-time work, an Irish
                Driving License, a Credit Card, and many other useful things. You should also keep in mind that you can
                not apply for PPSN unless you have a solid reason with sufficient proof.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="driving">
            <h2>A driving License</h2>
            <img src="Pic-1.png" alt="driving license">
            <p>
                Many jobs you will apply for here will need you to have a driving license. After
                successfully getting PPSN(If you are lucky), you can apply for a new Driving License or exchange your
                full foreign driving license.
