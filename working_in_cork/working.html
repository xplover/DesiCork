            If you are a student studying master or postgraduate diploma courses, then your visa allows you to work
            under some conditions. You will be allowed to work part-time(maximum 20 hours a week) during your semester
            and full-time (maximum 40 hours a week) on holidays. You should also keep in mind that a master's degree and
            diploma courses last one year, and they can be pretty intense. So if you are having difficulty keeping up
            with your study then should think twice about working while studying.

            After your graduation, Ireland gives you some time to work and gain experience. When your degree or diploma
            completes, you have two options:
        </p>
        <img src="two.jpg" alt="road split into two">
        <ol>
            <li>Go back to your Home Country</li>
            <li>Stay in Ireland and look for work and gains some Irish work experience</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            If you are doing an NQF-8 degree or diploma then you will have one year to look for work after study. If you
            have an NQF-9 degree or diploma then you will have two years to look for work.
        </p>

        <p>
            After the post-study work period, you still have two options:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Go back to your home country</li>
            <li>Extend your work visa and stay a little more</li>
        </ol>
